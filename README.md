Airline Satisfaction.ipynb: The notebook with analysis for this project 

## Purpose of the project 
I am trying to find out if airline industry can rely on passenger satisfaction survey to improve their service. 

## Analysis 
Throughout the analysis in the notebook, I use Data Visualization and Machine Learning techniques to find out that Class 
(Whether passenger fly in Business or Economy Class) has a big effect on how satisfy the passengers are. 
I think this will not help the Airline Industry improve their service, because airline don't decide if people purchase a business class or economy class ticket. 
If Airline solely rely on this factor to improve service, it would be completely unreliable.
